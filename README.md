# Tricky Susan website (backend)
<p align="justify">
This is the original repo for a promotional website for the band Tricky Susan, of which I am a part.</p>
<p align="justify">
Coded in JavaScript, Vue, HTML and CSS. Deployed in a semi complete state at trickysusan.herokuapp.com, where most of the development took place.</p>

When it was time to deploy for production, I realised my hosting package did not include Node.js code, so I had to remove it. I preserve it here for posterity, and in the hope that I eventually get round to reinstating it in the project. Specifically there is code here for:</p>

* A Contact Form that sends an email to the band email account via the Sendgrid API.
* A password protected admin page, providing the ability to update the News database.
